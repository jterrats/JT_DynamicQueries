    <!--
    ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This Named Credential uses Next-Gen External Credentials (OAuth 2.0):

    After deployment, you MUST manually create the External Credential:
    1. Create Authentication Provider (Salesforce OAuth 2.0) - see Step 1 in docs
    2. Create Connected App with OAuth settings - see Step 2 in docs
    3. Link Auth Provider to Connected App - see Step 3 in docs
    4. Create External Credential manually in UI:
       - Setup → External Credentials → New
       - Label: JT Tooling API External
       - Authentication Protocol: OAuth 2.0
       - Authentication Provider: Select JT_Tooling_API_Auth_Provider
       - Principal Type: Per User (recommended)
       - Scope: refresh_token full
       - Save and authenticate
    5. Edit this Named Credential:
       - Setup → Named Credentials → JT_Tooling_API
       - Select the External Credential created above
       - Save

    Complete setup instructions: docs/TOOLING_API_OAUTH_SETUP.md

    Note: External Credential cannot be deployed in metadata until Auth Provider exists,
    so it must be created manually in the UI after Auth Provider setup.
